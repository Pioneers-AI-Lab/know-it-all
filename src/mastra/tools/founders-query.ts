/**
 * Founders Query Tool - Founder Profile Information Retrieval
 *
 * This tool searches the founders.json knowledge base to find information about founders
 * in the Pioneer.vc accelerator. Used by the startups-agent for founder-specific queries.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Loads and searches founders.json data file
 * - Performs semantic search across founder profiles
 * - Returns matching founders with metadata
 * - Indicates whether results were found
 *
 * Data Source:
 * File: data/founders.json
 * Content: Founder objects with names, backgrounds, startups, expertise, etc.
 *
 * Search Strategy:
 * - Uses searchInObject helper for deep object searching
 * - Searches all founder fields (name, bio, startup, experience, etc.)
 * - Returns founders that match search terms
 * - Provides found flag for empty result handling
 *
 * Pipeline Position:
 * Startups Agent → Query Receiver → [Founders Query] → Data Formatter → Response Sender
 *
 * Output Format:
 * {
 *   founders: Array of matching founder objects,
 *   found: boolean (true if founders.length > 0)
 * }
 *
 * Important Notes:
 * - Returns COMPLETE object with both founders array and found flag
 * - Data formatter expects this complete structure
 * - Works in tandem with startups-query for company-specific queries
 * - Both tools are available to startups-agent
